This folder is for testing and prototyping Graphical RNN deep learning models for time series data.

To properly use create:
data_collection/data/
figs/
backtest/output/

Add your quandl and tiingo keys to the keychain.

Pull necassary data and interface training via the Training_API class.
The appropriate callbacks from the training API will perform automated backtests.


Once a model is selected, fill out a neassary config for the REST API and push to production.
